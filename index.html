# 🔥 RBA FIT METABOLIC FINISHER GUIDE

## PHASE 3 FINISHERS (Weeks 9-12 - Hypertrophy Phase)

### 🔵 TUESDAY FINISHER: Ladder Sprint + Burpees
**Duration:** 8 minutes EMOM (Every Minute On the Minute)
**Equipment:** Agility ladder
**Location:** Home (living room/hallway)

**Protocol:**
- Minute 1: Agility ladder (fast feet down and back) + 3 burpees
- Minute 2: Agility ladder (fast feet down and back) + 3 burpees
- Minute 3: Agility ladder (fast feet down and back) + 3 burpees
- Repeat for 8 rounds

**Why This Works:**
- Total body conditioning without taxing chest/back/shoulders heavily
- Legs are fresh (not leg day)
- Agility ladder = footwork + cardio
- Burpees = metabolic stress
- Heart rate stays elevated = fat burning

**Coaching Notes:**
- Focus on SPEED through ladder, not perfection
- Burpees can be modified (step back instead of jump if needed)
- Rest = whatever time is left in that minute
- If you finish in 30 seconds, you get 30s rest

### 🟢 FRIDAY FINISHER: Ball Slams Circuit
**Duration:** 10 minutes (2 rounds × 5 min)
**Equipment:** Medicine ball (15-20 lbs), Exercise ball
**Location:** Home

**Round 1 (5 minutes - as many rounds as possible):**
1. Med Ball Slams × 10
2. Exercise Ball Mountain Climbers × 20
3. Med Ball Overhead Squats × 10
4. Exercise Ball Plank Hold × 30 seconds
5. Med Ball Russian Twists × 20

**Rest 1 minute between rounds**

**Round 2:** Repeat the circuit

**Why This Works:**
- Upper body is SMOKED from the week
- This uses core + conditioning (doesn't tax chest/back/arms heavily)
- Medicine ball keeps intensity high
- Exercise ball adds instability = more core engagement
- Perfect end to a high-volume upper week

**Coaching Notes:**
- Move FAST between exercises
- Quality over speed on exercise ball work (stability)
- If you can't finish the circuit in 5 min, that's fine - keep moving
- Ball slams = explosive but controlled

## ALTERNATIVE: PELOTON INTEGRATION

If you prefer Peloton workouts instead:

- 5-min ride + 5-min core class

**Avoid:**
- Heavy climbing rides (will tax legs before Wednesday HIIT)
- Upper body strength classes (you just did upper!)

### Friday After Upper:
**Best Choice:**
- 10-min "Recovery" or "Low Impact" ride
- 10-min "Intervals & Arms" (light weights)
- 5-min ride + 5-min yoga flow

**Avoid:**
- Power Zone Max (too intense before Saturday)
- Heavy resistance work

## 💡 COACHING TIPS

### Do's:
✅ Keep moving - rest periods should be brief
✅ Focus on form even when tired
✅ Modify if needed (you've already trained hard)
✅ Track your rounds/reps (progressive overload applies here too)
✅ Hydrate during finishers

### Don'ts:
❌ Don't go to absolute failure (save that for main lifts)
❌ Don't add weight to finishers (bodyweight + light implements)
❌ Don't skip if you're exhausted (listen to your body)
❌ Don't do finishers on leg days (Monday has enough volume)
❌ Don't do finishers on Wednesday (full HIIT day already)

## 🔄 PROGRESSION

### Weeks 9-10:
- Follow protocols as written
- Focus on completing the time
- Learn the movements

### Weeks 11-12:
- Increase intensity (faster pace)
- Add 1-2 reps to burpees (3→4)
- Increase med ball weight if too easy
- Decrease rest between circuit rounds
